1. Some subtitles contain foreign words and irrelevant punctuation marks, cuz I ~~`am mentally retarded`~~  ~~`don't support nature saving idea`~~  ~~`fell in love with Olena Zelenska`~~  ~~`am planting & unifying bread with Mr. Lukashenko`~~  ~~`raped Yanukovych`~~ ~~`kissed with Zelenskyi`~~ ~~`did ♂Fisting♂ to Putin`~~ ~~`did ♂Spanking♂ Yermak`~~ ~~`Don't go to the EU with Poroshenko`~~ ~~`disbanded the Ministry of Education `~~`(but I'd like to)` didn't find any harmonic words in the songs. You can help me by suggesting any correction ideas in "Issues" or by manual correction & clicking on "Pull Request".
1. Subtitles are an inseparable part of the "Misheard-Ukrainian (Pochulosj)" beta project (I guess it's a whole one here...) (hereinafter - Project).
I, encourager and creator of `d`e Project, made it as a fork of "the Russian Misheard (Poslyshalosj)" project.
This project is dead as of now. By 4th year already.
1. Repository management controls - President.
1. Constitution has been approved by 14 January, 2020 (It's English version has been approved by 29 April, 2020).

## Way of addition\correction\truncation
*Note: correction applies to all files.*
If you wish to add some songs to the project - pls add it by two ways:
### "Issues" tab
Addition - Write song's name (Thoroughly).
Correction: pls write file's\s' name & possible correction elements.
If you think that something is wrong, e.g. I added a song in prohibited language, or words' in prohibited language to original words language ratio exceeds 2 (>2:1; or >66,66%), then you can ~~appeal~~ ~~complain~~ report a problem on ...tab... Well, you know it by yourself.
### Manually
Addition: write those files & click on "Pull Request";
Correction - Fork file(s) to your profile & edit.

I'll look into both ways as fast as I can.
## FAQ:

Q: When was your project born and what are the reasons for making it?
A: As you can see, last change of one of songs was made right up to 2019 October. That is, first change (creation of first subtitles) I made in 2019 September, with birth of idea on summer of 2019. First and foremost reason is death of Russian ["Misheard" ("Poslyshalosj") project](https://www.youtube.com/user/MisheardsReloaded), but I have another reasons and can't explain all of them.

Q: Is your project fully independent?
A: No. I use songs from "Poslyshalosj" project (except new), and I, to make my Project fully independent, need to redirect (translate) all songs from it (except forbidden). It's like some kind of autonomy as a part of "Poslyshalosj".

Q: Will you close the Project?
A: ~~I would like to, but it holds me down. **Somebody hElP mE!!!11!11111!!!1**~~ No. The Project can't be closed. Foreign songs will keep appearing (WUT?) even after ~~the end of Zelenskyi's Presidentship term~~ my death.

Q: We want to place ~~sum addzzzz~~ an advertisement block in your subtitles\constitution\progress. We advise you 1000$ monthly.
A: My project, & then all above-listed are officially non-commercial (and I don't spy for proprietary). PPPL bans all terms of placing ads & receiving money by third parties. Github will furiously punish all for any opportunity to earn money on every project with open source code and\or public licences (GNU, PPPL, MIT etc).

Q: Why won't you add English, Russian, Belarusian, Polish, & Ukrainian language songs to the project?
A: ~~I want, but some unknown mystic power holds me!!!111!!11~~ No! Unfortunately, I can't do this because of history & political correctness about `deez` languages (taunting).

Q: What events won't let you add `deez` songs?
A: ~~Governors of countries, which use these languages will bully me, that's why.~~ I said, historical!

Q: But which?
A: Mr\Mrs\Ms User, stop asking! Historical experts and\or locals (real locals, not immigrants) know, who governed Kyiv during these events. Yes, I focus on Kyiv, cuz it's the birth place of the project, not of an idea. Idea could be born anywhere. But if you don't know, I'll tell you chronologically "which" ↓

## Historical reasons
* 1363 - Kyiv is now under Grand Duchy of Lithuania;
* 1363-1596 - Grand Duchy of Lithuania governs Kyiv;
* 1596 - [Union of Lublin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_of_Lublin) (union of modern Lithuania and Poland into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth);
* 1596-1667 - Kyiv is under Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth;
* 1667 - Kyiv came under power of Muscovy by [Truce of Andrusovo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truce_of_Andrusovo);
* 1667-1917 - Russian Empire's Government;
* 1917-1920 - First Independence of Ukraine (was PRU);
* 1920-1941 - Kyiv suffers under USSR;
* 1941-1943 - Reichscommissariat Ukraine (Kyiv has been reoccupied in 1943 (English is from there) by USA\USSR army);
* 1943-1991 - Suffers again under USSR;
* 1991-∞ - Independence of Ukraine.

Belarus shares its history with Kyiv (until 2014) (the Belarusian language is prohibited cuz of likeliness with the Ukrainian one).

Q: I understand, but why won't you ban Lithuanian & German songs? You said that Kyiv was under Lithuania & Germany!
A: Cuz I don't know Lithuanian & badly know German.

Q: Is it all because of personal attitude to languages?
A: No, for God's sake! Believe me, no human in the world could know any language very good. It's the same about those languages, which I don't add to the project. By the way, do you know any Lithuanian song, except anthem of Lithuania? Or some German song, except any Rammstein song and anthem of Germany?
If you don't - what are we talking about?

Q: Yu f0skhic$tisk p1g, stuuup bulen dizzszsszzs l0nguajez!!!111!!!11111!!11!!!!!!!!1!11
A: $Username, stop immediately and go to school, 'cause it's too early for you to sit on the net for this age!

Q: Hey you, close your project immediately, or I'll drag you to many courts for copyright violation!

A: Syjenduk (if it's you), comrade, I don't violate your copyright, since:
I write subtitles' text by myself;
My policy differs from yours (what eliminates all copyright infringement claims against me);
I don't add English, Russian, Belarusian, Polish, and Ukrainian to the Project, because there are many ones, & of historical reasons (^);
I don't compile video with words, which you misheard, but I write subtitles;
Subtitles, considering my «Free» licence, belong to me, not to you;
My Project is a **FORK** (only subtitle) from your project, not its full copy (I clearly said that in first subtitles and in the head of the file);
& actually, I want to help you, but I see that I do it of no effect.
But:
What do you do through your videos leads to discord (not [Discord App](https://discord.gg)) (like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXb8yNrDQDY&lc=UgjvyN6xzgZPHHgCoAEC)) and violates copyright (this time not mine & not yours, but authors' of videos);
You tear out of context some video pieces (also bit carelessly) and you assign words to them, so many users don't understand, where did you hear that;
If you're going to call me to the court - obey local laws. But pls note that **I** can drag you to courts too for harassing me.

Since I've noticed I do it of no effect, I'll help *myself.*

Q: As, que tool meh?
A: Japan, say jeu time!

Q: What do these marks mean, like "WUT" or "Kill Me"?
A: They make correction\truncation\addition important to the text.

Q: How is it - Thoroughly?
A: As:
 * Song:
 * Lang:
 * Words in prohibited language to original words' language ratio (optional):
 * Probably misheard words (optional):
 * Are you sure in your message and are sure that creator & encourager won't deny your request?: Y\n
 * Message (optional):

Silent request - silent deny.

Q: I understood all, but I still have questions, which are not related to project. Where can I ask?
A: Pm me. It's a project page, not question one.
