1. Some subtitles contain foreign words and irrelevant punctuation marks, cuz I ~~`am mentally retarded`~~  ~~`don't support nature saving idea`~~  ~~`fell in love with Olena Zelenska`~~  ~~`am planting & unifying bread with Mr. Lukashenko`~~  ~~`raped Yanukovych`~~ ~~`kissed with Zelenskyi`~~ ~~`did ♂Fisting♂ to Putin`~~ ~~`did ♂Spanking♂ Yermak`~~ ~~`don't go to the EU with Poroshenko`~~ ~~`disbanded the Ministry of Education `~~`(but I'd like to)` didn't find any harmonious words in the songs. You can help me by suggesting any correction ideas in "Issues" or by manual correction & clicking on "Pull Request".
1. Subtitles are an inseparable part of the "Misheard-Ukrainian (Pochulosj)" beta project (I guess it's a whole one here...) (hereinafter - Project). <br>
I, encourager and creator of `d`e Project, made it as a fork of the "Russian Misheard (Poslyshalosj)" project (sometimes referred to as Parent). <br>
Authors of Parent are no longer interested in continuing it as of now. It's dead by 5th year already.

## Way of addition\correction\truncation
*Note: correction applies to all files.*
If you wish to add some songs to the project - pls add it by two ways:
### "Issues" tab
Addition - Write song's name (Thoroughly*). <br>
Correction: pls write file's\s' name & possible correction elements. <br>
If you think that something is wrong, e.g. I added a song in prohibited language, or words' in prohibited language to original words language ratio exceeds 2 (>2:1; or >66,66%), then you can ~~appeal~~ ~~complain~~ report a problem on ...tab... Well, you know it by yourself.
### Manually
Addition: write those files & click on "Pull Request"; <br>
Correction - Fork file(s) to your profile & edit.

I'll look into both ways as fast as I can.

Thoroughly is:
*Note: round-bracketed are (optional)*
 * Song (Artist):
 * Lang:
 * (Words in prohibited language to original words' language ratio):
 * (Probable misheard words (the more - the better):
 * Are you sure in your message and are sure that creator & encourager won't deny your request?: Y\n
 * (Message):
#### Example:
 * Song: Blue Bird - Ikimonogakari
 * Lang: Japanese
 * Words in prohibited language to original words' language ratio: N\A, 0%
 * Probable misheard words: "Have a tan, and Tara"; "Kana Jimin of made, oboe, ra reason" (dismiss that, words should be in Ukrainian in understandable alphabet ↓)
 * Yes, I'm sure.
 * If you'd do this - you're a madlad, & need much time for figuring out the song.
 
Understandable alphabets are Cyrillic, Latin, Greek, Katakana, Hiragana and Hangeul. Experimentally support pinyin. This is the order of priority. Any other alphabet is prioritised last by default. For example:

`Доброго вечора, ми з України! (Good evening, we're from Ukraine!)` posted today <br>
has higher priority than:
`Δόμπρογο βέτσορα, μυ ζ Ουκραΐνυ!`, posted yesterday, <br>
and even higher than:
`的部落河 为绰然，没则 乌克拉依呢！` posted a week ago. This isn't a yet supported alphabet, so the sentence will be parsed ONLY if I have a decent amount of time and\or no work). <br>
But:
`Ґуд івнінґ, уі ар фром Юкрейн!` <br>
is outprioritised to:
`도브로호 봬초라, 므 즈 우크라이느！`, because the first is in English, written in Cyrillic (zero priority, is into delet), and the latter is in Ukrainian, written in Hangeul (6th in normal queue).
