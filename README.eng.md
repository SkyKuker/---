1. Some subtitles contain foreign words and irrelevant punctuation marks, cuz I ~~`am mentally retarded`~~  ~~`don't support nature saving idea`~~  ~~`fell in love with Olena Zelenska`~~  ~~`am planting & unifying bread with Mr. Lukashenko`~~  ~~`raped Yanukovych`~~ ~~`kissed with Zelenskyi`~~ ~~`did ♂Fisting♂ to Putin`~~ ~~`did ♂Spanking♂ Yermak`~~ ~~`don't go to the EU with Poroshenko`~~ ~~`disbanded the Ministry of Education `~~`(but I'd like to)` didn't find any harmonious words in the songs. You can help me by suggesting any correction ideas in "Issues" or by manual correction & clicking on "Pull Request".
1. Subtitles are an inseparable part of the "Misheard-Ukrainian (Pochulosj)" beta project (I guess it's a whole one here...) (hereinafter - Project). <br>
I, encourager and creator of `d`e Project, made it as a fork of the "Russian Misheard (Poslyshalosj)" project (sometimes referred to as Parent). <br>
Authors of Parent are no longer interested in continuing it as of now. It's dead by 5th year already.

## Way of addition\correction\truncation
*Note: correction applies to all files.*
If you wish to add some songs to the project - pls add it by two ways:
### "Issues" tab
Addition - Write song's name (Thoroughly*). <br>
Correction: pls write file's\s' name & possible correction elements. <br>
If you think that something is wrong, e.g. I added a song in prohibited language, or words' in prohibited language to original words language ratio exceeds 2 (>2:1; or >66,66%), then you can ~~appeal~~ ~~complain~~ report a problem on ...tab... Well, you know it by yourself.
### Manually
Addition: write those files & click on "Pull Request"; <br>
Correction - Fork file(s) to your profile & edit.

I'll look into both ways as fast as I can.
